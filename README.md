# Reengineering_Focalization_2025

This repository includes the notebooks and a table of results for the short paper **Investigating Conceptual Plasticity: Towards Detecting a Re-Conceptualization of Focalization with Large Language Models**.

The paper investigates the extent to which LLMs are able to learn a redefinition of a concept from literary studies, focalization, and apply it adequately to text examples. It shows that, with one exception, there are no statistically significant differences between the LLM output for prompts with and without the redefinition.
