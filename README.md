# Reengineering_Focalization_2025

This repository includes the notebooks and a table of results for the short paper **Investigating Conceptual Plasticity: Towards Detecting a Re-Conceptualization of Focalization with Large Language Models**.

The paper investigates the extent to which LLMs are able to learn a redefinition of a concept from literary studies, focalization, and apply it adequately to text examples.
